    TODO: Before you release your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To do this, you can either add your release key credentials to your existing
    key, or create a new key.

    Note that this file specifies the API key for the release build target.
    If you have previously set up a key for the debug target with the debug signing certificate,
    you will also need to set up a key for your release certificate.

    Follow the directions here:

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/signup
    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=C3:91:4F:8D:CD:87:01:3A:75:66:66:0C:24:93:E0:80:5D:98:AE:AD%3Bcom.shoplex.shoplex

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
